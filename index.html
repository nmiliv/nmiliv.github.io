    <h1>Hey there!</h1>
    <h2>I'm Noa, I make things, and sometimes remember to post them places</h2>
    <p>Mostly mechanical/aerospace things. I'll get excited about nearly anything space related, but computers, linux, and music/modular synths are also pretty cool. <br>
    This place is still under construction so uhh don't worry if there's still a bunch of missing content :)</p>

    <p>Why does this website look like this? I've had a million different ideas bouncing around my head for what my portfolio website should look like since about as long as I can remember (15 or 16 is probably the age), but all those ideas would inevitably get too complex and not only would quickly get out of my reach, but would take a while to implement even if I was much better at the whole webdev thing. Or maybe not. Either way, after many years of feature creep I have decided to remove all features and make something simple in pure HTML, because it works and I can do it. Personally I think HTML has a neat look to it! (and yes, I am a fan of <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"> "This is a motherfucking website"</a>)</p>

            <h3>Spelinking</h3>
            <p>A word/activity I made up that's a cross between spelunking (cave exploration) and links -- exploring old websites by following random (safe) links, editing URLs to traverse filepaths, and so on. There's a bunch of websites from all walks of time that are still up and running and it's fun to take a lil walk through history. Sometimes it's finding old research papers, or educational resources, other times old blogs or even communities that were once thriving but are no frozen in a time long gone. Sometimes I'll even meet someone who's found some of the same sites I've found (like hyperphysics). Some cool places I've found and other tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Searching for research topics usually pulls up some good stuff, since a lot of universities made a lot of the early webpages and never took them down</li>
                <li>MIT in particular still has loads of their stuff from the 90's and early 2000's just lying around. And since it's MIT, that time period had a lot of people making their own personal websites. Some are even still in use!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Linux</h3>
            <p>I grew up in a Mac household, but didn't really like being locked in to the Apple environment and eventually had to fully jump ship because of engineering school (a woefully small number of CAD packages are available for Mac). After years of battling the Windows operating system I thought computers were "just like that sometimes." Except sometimes was actually all the time, a fact I quickly realized after dual booting to Manjaro Linux. Sure Linux will still give me an issue sometimes, but hot damn are those issues so much better documented and easier to fix. It is a blessing to be able to enjoy working with my computer's operating system rather than having to constantly fight it (my Windows Solidworks install is still stuck in my OneDrive for whatever reason, Windows taking up half my RAM while doing nothing, Windows File Explorer using 99% of my CPU to delete a file, the absolute dumpster fire that is the Windows partition management system, the list keeps on going). My Windows partition has been happily collecting dust in the corner since September 2023.</p>

            <h3>Biking/running/hiking</h3>
            <p>Sometimes I do this a little too much. Stuff like "I'll go for a little walk before lunch" turning into a 15+ mile trek across the countryside that takes the whole day. Sure you could probably get further in a car, but there's just so many cool little things you can see when you have the freedom to veer off into the buches at the slightest distraction.</p>
