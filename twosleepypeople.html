<h1>film review: two sleepy people (2025)</h1>
<p style="text-align: center">(<a href="index.html">home</a>)</p>

<p>I recently watched the indie film <i>Two Sleepy People</i> (2025) by Baron Ryan. Why? Because it has Caroline Grossman and she made funny videos on youtube when I was little. Unfortunately, the film was really good and I accednetally wrote a 5,000 word essay-looking thing about the film (context: if you were one of my middle school English teachers, you would be thoroughly surprised at the fact that I voluntarily wrote anything). Now my fingers hurt. And now you can also read my thoughts on the film. You, yes YOU, the reader, need to go watch this film RIGHT NOW.</p>
<br>

<h1>Uncontrollable ramblings about Two Sleepy People (2025)</h1>
<p>Recently I got to see the film <i>Two Sleepy People</i> in theaters. Why? Because I watched a funny video on youtube when I was 15 and the film was made by the person who made that funny video. So I was thinking "hey, this might be a decent film, might as well go watch it." But I was wrong. Very wrong. This film SLAPS. I love this film so much. There's so many things in the plot and the little details in the backgrounds of shots and the ways that shots are set up and so many other things that I absolutely adore about this film and I have been unable to stop thinking and/or typing about this film for the past two days.</p>
<p>The basic gist of the film is that you've got these two coworkers Syd and Lucy, they've just met after the companies they worked at had a merger. They feel like they've known each other forever, but they can't figure out why, and there's no chance they could have met somewhere else. Lucy lives alone with a bunch of houseplants and has some trauma that she thinks she's worked through, and Syd lives with his wife Donna, but their relationship is not working out. At night, Lucy and Syd have a dream where they find themselves in a house they don't actually know, and, to the surprise of both of them, realize that they are inexplicably married to each other with no memory of actually getting married, having a conversation as if they've been married for years before suddenly remembering that they both met each other earlier that same day and that neither of them actually lives in the house where they find themselves. Eventually Syd and Lucy find out that they are having the same shared dream, and that the dream realm acts as a place for them to work through their real-life issues, childhood experiences, and help each other improve as human beings. In real life, they never really interact outside of a professional setting, but in the dream realm, they help each other come to terms with their childhoods and improve the way they function in life. </p>
<p>For the purposes of this, I'm going to call the place where the dreams happen the dream realm, Syd and Lucy’s house in the dream realm will be referred to as the womb, and the space outside the womb is referred to as the nightmare stage (we will see why later).</p>
<h2>All of the symbolisms</h2>
<p>It's so cool when films actually use visuals to help tell the story in ways other than “object exists” or “action happened.” Every shot in the film has some second meaning, either with the objects present in the shot, or how the shot is framed itself. The film is not always about 100% realism, it is not filmed like a documentary or like a third party awkwardly standing in the room watching somebody’s breakup (some Marvel movies are arguably filmed like documentaries. There is nothing wrong with that, it fits the format). There is no limit on the number of houseplants one can have in a house. Hell, half the film happens in a dream realm, where continuity does not have to even exist at all. The way the film is shot is more about conveying how the characters are feeling and interacting rather than what would “actually” happen in real life, and it is nice to see more films doing it these days (like the Barbie movie and Wes Anderson films, or older things like <span class="headnote" id="norse">Norse creation myths</span>). Having the characters inhabit spaces that are a reflection of their conscious state just helps give the film so much more depth into how the characters are feeling that you would normally only see in a book where the author can spend a paragraph writing out what is going on in someone's head <span class="headnote" id="dune"></span>. </p>
<p>An example of this more visual-over-documentary style of filming would be the framing of some of the shots. Specifically one shot where over half the screen is black, with cropping so aggressive you could mistake it for a scene from Ernst Lubitsch’s Die Bergkatze. The scene from Two Sleepy People I am referencing is the pasta cooking scene, where Syd is making dinner for Donna. The scene is shot from outside Syd and Donna's house at night, where all we can see are the illuminated living room window framing Donna, and the kitchen window framing Syd. Syd and Donna are both trapped in these little bubbles, entirely separate, and they cannot both inhabit the same space: when Syd invites Donna over to taste the pasta, Donna immediately kicks Syd out of the kitchen window (bubble) and into the living room window. They swap places, but are unable to inhabit the same space at the same time. Most scenes with Syd and Donna don't actually show them in the same shot; when they are fighting, the camera swaps between individual shots of the individuals rather than showing both of them at the same time. This is compared (sometimes in back to back sequences) with Syd and Lucy arguing, where Syd and Lucy are always in the same shot. There are only two prominent scenes with Syd and Donna in the same shot, one after a fight where they make up (interrupted by their goldfish dying, where Syd instantly falls out of the shared moment and is focused on something else). The other shared Syd and Donna shot is during the breakup sequence at the end of the film. However, there is so much more symbolism that needs to be covered in order to fully understand the breakup sequence when it comes to the motifs present. </p>
<p>First up are house plants, representing Lucy's state of mind. House plants overcrowd Lucy’s life, yet still feels alone, trying to fill the void by buying more houseplants. House plants seem to be a stress response for Lucy. Before we know of how many house plants she owns, she purchases a new house plant after a stressful day at work. When she gets home, it is immediately lost in a sea of other house plants that crowd Lucy’s house. It is unclear whether she actually has a place to live in her jungle of house plants. That is compared to the end of the movie, after she moves to a new apartment: there are things other than the houseplants, there is more vibrancy and variety in her life, and the house feels more lived in. There are still a couple plants, but there are other things too.</p>
<p>The houseplants become a motif for Lucy, and Lucy's impact on Syd. There is one scene where Donna asks Syd to buy a painting for their house. Donna hates the painting Syd picks out, and essentially takes Syd’s choice of painting as an attack against her. In reality, Syd was just trying to express himself, something he normally would not have done. The interesting bit is that the painting Syd buys is framed by houseplants, something that was previously only associated with Lucy.</p>
<p>Another symbol, more associated with Syd and Donna’s relationship, are the stacks of moving boxes filling their home. The box stacks start off looming, and it is hard to tell whether Syd and Donna are moving into or moving out of their house. It takes forever for them to unpack their boxes, and even when they are shown to be unpacking, it seems to have little effect on the number of boxes present. Syd and Donna must constantly dodge around the boxes of unpacked baggage to even complete the smallest task. Sort of as if they have unpacked emotional baggage…. It is also later alluded to that a lot of the boxes in Syd's house are full of books. Syd aspires to be an author (a book Syd hopes to publish is present in the dream realm), and the books become Syd's motif. When Lucy moves into her new house after exiting the womb, one of the things she adds to her new house is a bookshelf with books on it, showing Syd’s impact on Lucy as a character <span class="headnote" id="memory"></span>.
We have two motifs, one of Lucy and her houseplants, another of Syd and Donna’s emotional baggage box towers, and the relation of Syd and Donna inhabiting separate or joined shots in the sequences featuring the couple, and that gets combined with the camera work of showing Syd and Donna either talking with or talking past each other during the breakup sequence.</p>
<p>At first, the camera is doing its usual camera jumping. Syd and Donna are not on the same wavelength. Syd has been mulling over this breakup for a while, while the whole concept is pretty new to Donna. Then the camera shows the couple in the same shot, but they are still visually separated by a houseplant interjecting across the screen (sort of like in the pasta/windows scene), where they can talk with each other but still aren't fully understanding each other. Finally, as Syd and Donna both come to terms with the breakup and fully understand each other, they are shown in the same shot together, but this time without the distractions of their pet goldfish suddenly dying. All the acting and framing and stuff is really good on its own in showing the progression of the breakup, but there's more things going on in the scene that make it so much more satisfying to watch and tie it all together and make it go so much harder even though it is such a harsh scene.</p>
<p>Rewinding the sequence a little, we have the shot where Syd and Donna are both in the same shot but still separated. What's separating them? A houseplant. Lucy. The whole breakup conversation would not have happened without Lucy, fully solidifying Lucy’s role in helping Syd face his relationship issues. But even when Donna and Syd are shown in the same shot, without any separation, there is still something different about their living room: the arrangement of the stacks of moving boxes has changed. The stacks are not haphazard anymore, instead being arranged in a sort of semi circle around the couch where Donna and Syd are sitting. The boxes are still there, the same way that Syd and Donna’s relationship issues are still present, but Syd and Donna do not have to dodge around the issues anymore. There is room for them to breathe. It looks a little like the boxes are listening to what they are saying, or like Syd and Donna are having a meeting with all of their emotional baggage. I thought that was cute when I first saw it, and I am choosing to continue interpreting it that way.</p>
<p>Both Lucy and Syd's original houses have blank white walls, undecorated: uninviting and uninspiring. Compare that with the house that Syd and Lucy live in when they're in the dream realm. It has lots of warm colors and is built with wood paneled walls. There are plenty of soft objects, blankets on the couch, warm lighting, and even some smaller details like the tablecloth on the kitchen table being replaced by a quilt, turning an otherwise "hard" surface into something a little cozier. Then there's the red velvet stage curtains that lead to the space outside of the house, and when the curtains, with their center part, are lit from the outside, the whole space starts to look a little like a womb of sorts. Along with wide shots introducing us to the womb, there are two close shots that help set the space: one of a Turkish coffee pot, perfectly centered on the stove, and another shot of two mugs, perfectly posed back to back. Along with the general cozy atmosphere, these two shots help ground the space as a place where Syd and Lucy can feel centered, connected, and in control of what is going on. Everything in the womb is deliberate, sensical, neither bare nor overcrowded, unlike Syd and Lucy's real life houses that are simultaneously empty yet suffocating.</p>
<p>So why the womb? While doing research for the marketing job, one of the themes they land on is motherly love and comfort, something all three of the main characters lack to some extent. One of the theories Syd finds in his research is Otto Rank's theory of birth, stating that the separation from the womb is a human's first experience with anxiety, and that there is some part of us that will always yearn to return back to the safety of the womb.</p>
<p>Offering that sort of warmth Rank talks about is basically the role the womb location serves in the film: it offers them a place that is safe from all of the outside chaos and traumas of their lives (such as the office, Syd's failing relationship and Lucy's lack of relationships, and both Syd and Lucy’s childhoods). The womb gives Syd and Lucy a space to help process themselves and improve as people. They can leave the womb to go to the nightmare stage, or re-enact scenes from their childhood from inside the womb, but the point is, they have control over what goes on in the dream realm and always have this option of going back into the safety of the womb <span class="headnote" id="ovaries"></span>.</p>
<p>That brings us to the nightmare stage, the place outside of the womb, on the other side of the slightly vaginal curtains (wow that is a sentence). The space outside of the womb usually manifests as a stage, where Syd, Lucy, and eventually Donna all watch (and in some ways re-live) traumatic scenes from their childhood. The retellings of the memories are pretty minimal in style, using the minimum number of actors and only the most important props (like a kitchen table or a dog), or even with the people manifesting as sock puppets. I think the stage setting was pretty cool in that it's kinda how you remember traumatic memories, there's only a couple of real objects you can actually remember cutting through the wall of emotions. It also offers Syd and Lucy a place to practice healthier ways of processing their pasts. I have some more notes about the idea of acting as it relates to the nightmare stage, but there are some other symbols that need talking about first.</p>
<p>There is one final detail in the womb that has to be my favorite, and it demonstrates the importance of all the little details woven into the film. There is one scene in the womb where Lucy is building a house of cards, she's finished the first level, and she's starting the second level before she gets startled by Syd entering the room, causing her to knock over the top level of the house of cards. However, the rest of the structure stays intact. Syd and Lucy end up having a whole argument, including hand waving and exasperating sighs that could potentially knock over the rest of the cards, but the bottom row of the house of cards stays intact the whole time. Am I weird for rooting for the house of cards during an argument scene? Just to be clear, the house of cards is not the focus of any of the shots, it is really just a thing in the background of a couple of the shots. But it still symbolizes the process of building up a relationship, and how it is not a linear process. Not everything goes smoothly all the time. Sometimes you go backwards a little bit. The house of cards surviving the argument really sums up what Lucy and Syd are talking about in the first place while they are jeopardizing the house of cards: arguing versus fighting, the idea of having a disagreement about the actions of one’s partner without attacking the character of one’s partner. Lucy and Syd are arguing, and the argument does knock over the top of the house of cards, but the foundation of the house is still there and survives through the argument.</p>
<p>That's what I really like about this movie. All the little details (and big details!) happening in the camera work and the symbolism and motifs, despite the fact that most of the plot happens in the audio and the dialogue. It reminds me of the first time I watched Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), where I didn't have audio or subtitles to go off of, but the plot in that film is conveyed almost entirely visually. Two Sleepy People is similar, but even better in this regard. You could theoretically just listen to the whole film like a radio show and I think you could still understand everything. The difference is that alongside the plot happening in the dialogue, there is a whole world of storytelling happening in the visuals that just adds a whole extra layer to the experience of the film.</p>
<p>Anyhow. That's just the motifs and the camera work. Which were really cool. But there are more things I want to talk about.</p>
<h2>Thoughts on some specific scenes and plot points</h2>
<p>One scene that I think gets some sort of “heavy lifting award” when it comes to the plot is the scene where we see Donna and Donna's childhood on the nightmare stage. This follows the surprise appearance of Donna in Syd and Lucy’s womb, a space that was previously only inhabited by Syd and Lucy, and a space that only Syd and Lucy know about. Syd and Lucy’s immediate concern is that if Donna now knows about Syd and Lucy’s marriage in the dream realm, that could cause awkward situations in the real world. The fact that Donna interacts with the nightmare stage simultaneously tells us two things: one of them is that Donna is not just some construct of the dream realm, but the fact that Donna has her own nightmare means that (in my opinion), the Donna in the dreams was the real Donna. This means Donna remembers what she saw in the dream, and now knows about Lucy and Syd’s (dream) marriage. The other big thing this scene does is that it humanizes Donna. Donna has been a bit of an insecure, controlling asshole through this whole film up until this point. Don't get me wrong, Syd has also been a terrible partner throughout the film by being avoidant and making conflicts worse in his own way, but we get to see Syd humanized in other settings, like in the office and in the dream realm, where we get to see the rest of his consciousness. Up until Donna’s nightmare scene, we have only ever seen Donna in conflict mode. Seeing the context for why Donna is insecure, what life experiences have shaped her, and that she's really just a normal, caring person underneath the neuroses, all really helps solidify Donna as a character, and the film would be infinitely weaker without that one scene. There is no one person responsible for the conflicts in the film; all of the characters are partially at fault for never fully resolving their own conflicts.</p>
<p>Wait, what was the thing I mentioned about neuroses? That's basically what the entire film is about! The definition I'm using here is from John Russon's book Human Experience. Russon’s whole argument is that our lived experience is shaped by our memories, especially our experiences as a child <span class="headnote" id="umwelt"></span>. Russon argues that neuroses are a sort of vestigial reaction to the world that used to be a productive way of dealing with some sort of childhood trauma, but ultimately is not helpful in navigating the adult world. The person with the neuroses may or may not be aware that their reactions are counterproductive to the situation that they are trying to resolve, but the neurotic person is still unable to stop themselves from exhibiting the neuroses. I used to have a copy of this book for my philosophy class, but the book was so bland that I gave it away once I was done reading it.</p>
<p>So how do Russon’s neuroses apply to Two Sleepy People? The different nightmare scenes are ways of representing these childhood experiences that lead to neuroses. For Donna, that is her pet dog being taken away by her parents because she didn't know how to “control” it – honestly a little unfair from her parents, and the situation leads her to feeling like she has to have control over everything around her in her life or else she will lose it, even going on to say that she “raised” Syd and that he would not be anything without her. The whole dog situation also makes Donna feel like anything that does not go to her plan is an attack against her, because every action has to have consequences, leading to a mentality of "the world is out to get me." She is aware of this and the impact this neurosis is having on her relationship with Syd, but ultimately she is unable to control the controlling impulse in any productive manner.
For Lucy, the nightmares and neuroses are from the experience of her mother bringing different men into the household seemingly every other week, many of them abusive or problematic in some way or another, and at one point Lucy has to defend her mother from one of the men her mother has brought home. This unstable childhood then leads Lucy to distrust any sort of intimacy or close relationship, eventually pushing people away and pretending everything is fine (purchasing large amounts of houseplants in order to cope).</p>
<p>Syd had a very overbearing father and a somewhat passive mother, demonstrated by a memory of child Syd eating dinner with his parents while the adult Syd watches from across the stage. Every little thing he asked for or wanted turned into a whole lecture on the government this or that and morphed into some huge complicated thing. Syd’s mother would try to help him out, but would ultimately get steamrolled by Syd’s father. This then leads to Syd taking a passive stance on most issues, never really getting around to doing anything and being conflict avoidant because he feels that doing otherwise (like simply asking for five dollars to buy a kite) will turn into an overcomplicated battle not worth fighting.</p>
<p>Going back to Russon, his whole idea was that if somebody has a neurosis, or these unproductive reactions to a situation, that person can re-learn the more appropriate, productive response to a situation. If we go back to the idea of the nightmare stage, what the nightmare stage is really giving to the characters is another chance to look back on and re-process their pasts: the things that are leading to their neuroses. In the case of Syd and Lucy voluntarily re-enacting some of their pasts from inside the womb, the dream realm gave them the chance to practice more appropriate responses to their neuroses, which is essentially the therapy Russon is recommending in his book. The fact that all of this learning and healing is happening on a stage, the place where acting happens, is just a really nice touch.</p>
<p>There is one scene that initially irked me a little. It is when Syd lives through his nightmare, when Syd becomes his own mother and Donna becomes Syd's father, and little Syd is still there asking for a kite. Again, this is a nightmare in the dream realm, so this makes perfect logical sense that you turn into your own mother and talk to your childhood self and also your dad is your wife but also you are your own child's mom. What originally bothered me with this scene was this thought of "oh no, they're just portraying Syd as being sort of emasculated by Donna by portraying Donna as the man in the family and Syd is the woman in the family," but I do not really think that is what was going on in the scene. I think that what is happening is a little more Freudian (only slight Freudian, none of the really weird stuff!): Syd sees a reflection of his parents in his relationship with Donna <span class="headnote" id="freud"></span>. The exact gender roles do not really matter in this scene, more so that Syd and Donna are replicating the same problematic patterns that Syd's parents were exhibiting. I think this is really well encapsulated by the fact that Syd's mom's dress does not fit Syd at all. Syd has wide shoulders and the dress just sits on him really weird. You can get a dress that comfortably fits wider shoulders (source: I have wide shoulders and own several dresses that fit me well). The dress not fitting Syd when he is playing the part of his mother is more emblematic of the fact that Syd does not actually fit the role of his mother; he is not being "emasculated," it's not like his role in the family is the mother or that he is a woman. What is being shown is that Syd is not cut out for that role of his mother (literally). I do not know if the dress not fitting Syd was a conscious decision by the filmmakers, but that is the nice thing about a piece of art being released into the wild:  I am free to interpret it however I want!</p>
<h2>Unanswered questions</h2>
<p>There's a couple of questions that the film doesn't directly answer. The first one is whether that was the "real" Donna in the dream realm, sort of is Donna an "active" participant in the dream capable of remembering what happened when she wakes up (like Syd and Lucy), or is she a more "passive" character like child Syd or the Lucy family sock puppets. I think the Donna in the dream realm is the real Donna, because she can still have her own nightmare sequence when we learn about her dog. The interesting thing is that Syd and Lucy don't actually know about the nightmare sequence, so they (initially) have no way of knowing whether Donna knows about the dream realm, which I think would leave Lucy and especially Syd with a lot of tension throughout the rest of their day as they wonder whether Donna remembers Syd's dream realm divorce with Donna and Lucy and Syd's dream realm marriage. Eventually this tension is resolved when Syd and Donna go to a holiday party, and Donna immediately wants to bail on the party when she sees that Lucy is a real, living, human being. Syd obliges, Donna and Syd drive home (and Lucy sees that they bailed on the holiday party), and Syd finally initiates the breakup with Donna. So in short: I think that was the real Donna in the dream realm, and I think Syd, Lucy, and Donna eventually all figured out everything they needed to know about each other and the dream realm, even though they never talked to each other about it.</p>
<p>An interesting side effect of Donna entering the womb is that the womb no longer functions like a womb during that scene. Before Donna’s entrance into the womb, everything in the womb was “safe.” The womb was just Syd and Lucy, and even though they could re-enact their nightmares in the womb or venture out onto the nightmare stage, they were ultimately still in control of the nightmare situation: either they could stop acting or re-enter the womb, respectively. That changes when Donna knocks on the door of the womb, which is a breach of how the womb functioned before: Donna is not something that is under Syd or Lucy's control. This is a pretty big change to the rules of how the womb worked before that. This detail is something that I think is relevant to the second unanswered question:</p>
<p>Do Syd and Lucy get together in the end? Syd and Donna get their divorce, and Lucy loses her job at the marketing agency, which would theoretically free up both Syd and Lucy to have a relationship in real life. After Lucy gets laid off and Syd and Donna break up (both happen on the same night), Syd and Lucy stop having the shared dreams. However, after the dreams stop, we do get to see several wide shots of the womb, with Syd and Lucy missing, but with the space clearly used and lived in: there are objects on the counters, the blanket is strewn across the couch as if someone has just gotten up, and the bed is clearly slept in. Along with Donna entering the womb earlier, these final shots of the womb really solidify that Syd and Lucy have been "born" again and are gone from the womb. The womb has still served a purpose. It has still been lived in, and the womb is still a part of Lucy and Syd as they go about their new lives, but the womb's purpose is complete; there is no need for Syd and Lucy to return to the womb.
 As for whether Syd and Lucy get together: in the film, they do not really see each other in person for a while after their rebirth, though they do catch up at a diner one day. Personally, I do not think they get together. Their relationship only really existed in the womb, and while their relationship in the womb has become a large part of who they are as human beings, they sort of have to move on as humans in the real world in the same way that they had to move on from the womb <span class="headnote" id="gaydar"></span>.</p>
<p>Anyhow, that's my stupidly long ramble about the film Two Sleepy People. I love this film so much and if there is ever a physical media release of it or something I will violate community guidelines in order to get my hands on a copy of this film. I hope you are able to see it in theatres and that you enjoy it as much as I did.</p>

<li class="footnote" id="freud">This is also a question that I always had as a queer person: how does the classical Freud idea of “you want to have sex with your opposite sex parent” mesh with people who aren't straight? The answer I have settled on since my youth is that it could really be some part of either of your parents that could be projected onto your potential mate(s), regardless of the gender of any party involved. It seems like Two Sleepy People takes a similar approach.</li>
<li class="footnote" id="gaydar">Though that may just be my gaydar screaming at me because Caroline Grossman, who portrays Lucy in the film, is lesbian and would not date a guy. Maybe my gaydar is just penetrating through the veneer of acting.  I do not know. Maybe they actually do get together.
